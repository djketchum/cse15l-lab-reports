## Exploring Command-Line Options with 'Find' Command

The first new command line option I found was the -size, which goes through the files in a directory and returns only the files above or below a certain memory size, depending on how the command is set up. 
which is entered into the command line as: 
`find directoryName -size +/- # Unit`
