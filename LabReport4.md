To edit the file after running the commands shown, I did `vim ListExamples.java` , then pressed j 11 times, pressed e once to get to end of index2 word, pressed x to delete the 1, then i to enter insert mode and then 2, then `Esc` then :wq! to save the changes
then bash test.sh, to show that it was running fine.
